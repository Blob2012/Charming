<p> Jewlery is a gift from the heart. It is a way to show someone that you are affectionate for them. So what better jewlery is there to buy than homemade, beutiful ones made and modeled by young people, who feel the love in jewelry?  </p>
<p> Charming Jewlery was founded by Mia, age ten, and Milly, age 11. They found joy in little beads they found on bracelets. And they absolutely adored the charms. That is why they decided on the name Charming, from the amazing charms they saw. </p>
